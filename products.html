We understand that glasses have now become more of a fashion accessory and , therefore, our well trained and knowledgeable staff offer expert advice on which frame highlights your best features and best suits your lens type.

          As a “Varilux Specialist” practice, our lenses offer the high quality and performance synonymous with the Varilux brand. We also dispense other brands of lenses such as Zeiss and Seiko.
          <br>
          When we give our advice in choosing the right frame for you, we also consider what lens is best suited. We listen to our patients needs.
          <br><br>
          The choice of most people now is to have their lenses as thin and as flat as possible. In addition to this, is to have an anti-reflection coating on the lenses. This makes the lens look cosmetically better and helps reduce deep scratching and guards against distracting light reflection. Our most advanced lenses carry a two year guarantee against scratches and defects.
          <br><br>
          For those who have a varifiocal prescription, we offer a varied range of lenses that provide ever more effective visual acuity with more natural vision that best suits each individual’s needs. Our Varilux lenses adapt to every presbyopic patient no matter what their lifestyle and visual requirements are.
          <br><br>
          Most lenses can now be ordered to incorporate the photochromic element which automatically adapt to all changing light conditions to reduce eye fatigue and eye strain. Lenses can also be tinted for those with light sensitive eyes, perfect for driving as colour perception remains constant and ideal as sun lenses thanks to the UV protection they provide.
          <br><br>
          Prices of single vision lenses start from £39.00.
          <br>
          Prices of bifocal lenses start from £60.00

        <div class="text-hover">
          At The Opticians at Marchmont, we firmly believe that all people who require vision correction should have the option of wearing contact lenses. Contact lenses bring you the freedom from glasses every day, when playing sport or going out to special occasions. We will advise you on the best contact lens for your needs and all our lenses come with a competitive price (that includes solution and after-care appointments whenever you require) and payment plan/method. We stock all major brands of contact lenses.
          <br><br>
          Major advances in technology now mean that lenses are more comfortable and easier to wear than ever before. We fit all lenses from daily disposable to extended wear and gas permeable also.
          <br>
          We offer a free contact lens trial service to anyone so make sure to take us up on this. For first time wearers, the optometrist will place a lens on your eyes to see the difference and benefits from glasses. We will then teach you how to handle the lenses, insert and remove them and care for them before letting you to take them home for an extended trial.
          <br><br>
          We also are happy for youngsters to try lenses if they are unhappy with wearing glasses as we appreciate difficulty that can be caused.
